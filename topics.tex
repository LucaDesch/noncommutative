We collect here some topics for final presentations. Some topics
can also be used as bachelor's or master's theses.

\subsection*{Formanek's theorem}

The theorem is stated in Theorem...

\subsection*{Carter subgroups}

The existence of Carter subgroups appears in Theorem \ref{thm:Carter}. For the proof of Carter's result, we refer to \cite{MR0123603}.

\subsection*{It\^o's theorem}

This nice theorem is surprisingly easy to prove. See Theorem \ref{thm:Ito}. 

\subsection*{The Mann subgroup}

\subsection*{The Chermak--Delgado subgroup}

\subsection*{Hall's subgroups}

For finite solvable groups, Hall developed a theory similar to that of Sylow subgroups....

\subsection*{Sylow systems}

\subsection*{Hall's marriage theorem}

\subsection*{Burnside's normal complement theorem}

\subsection*{The Wielandt automorphism tower theorem}

One striking application of subnormality is a beautiful result 
of Wielandt about the automorphism tower of a finite group with trivial center. See 
Theorem~\ref{thm:Wielandt:automorphism}.

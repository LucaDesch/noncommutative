We collect here some topics for final presentations. Some topics
can also be used as bachelor's or master's theses.

\subsection*{Formanek's theorem}

Kaplansky zero divisors conjecture (Conjecture \ref{conjecture:zero}) 
holds for super-solvable groups. 
This is Formanek's theorem, see Theorem \ref{thm:Formanek:zerodivisors}. 

\subsection*{Carter subgroups}

The existence of Carter subgroups appears in Theorem \ref{thm:Carter}. For the proof of Carter's result, we refer to \cite{MR0123603}.

\subsection*{It\^o's theorem}

This nice theorem is surprisingly easy to prove. See Theorem \ref{thm:Ito}. There is a generalization
found by Sysak, see Theorem \ref{thm:Sysak}. 

\subsection*{The Mann subgroup}

How the set of sizes of conjugacy classes of a finite group influence 
the structure of the group? A partial answer goes back to Mann. See Theorem \ref{thm:Mann}. 

%\subsection*{The Chermak--Delgado subgroup}

\subsection*{Hall's subgroups}

For finite solvable groups, Hall developed a theory similar to that of Sylow. The proofs
presented in Theorems \ref{theorem:HallE} and \ref{theorem:HallC} (see page \pageref{theorem:HallC}) use
the Schur--Zassenhaus theorems. 

%\subsection*{Sylow systems}

\subsection*{Hall's marriage theorem}

Given a set of $n$ employees, fill out a list of the jobs each of them
would be able to preform. We can give each person the ``perfect'' job
if and only if for every $k\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ 
the union of any $k$ of the lists contains at least $k$ jobs. 

For a proof of the Hall marriage theorem, see \cite{MR33330}. The theorem is equivalent to several other
powerful theorems in combinatorics. Hall's theorem 
provides a combinatorial way of solving 
Exercise \ref{xca:Hall:cosets}. 

%\subsection*{Burnside's normal complement theorem}

\subsection*{The Wielandt automorphism tower theorem}

One striking application of subnormality is a beautiful result 
of Wielandt about the automorphism tower of a finite group 
with trivial center. See 
Theorem~\ref{thm:Wielandt:automorphism}.

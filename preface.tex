The notes correspond to the master  
course \emph{Non-commutative Algebra} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into thirteen two-hours lectures. 

Most of the material is based on standard 
results on group algebras covered in the VUB course \emph{Associative Algebras}. Lecture  
notes for this course are freely available at 
\url{https://github.com/vendramin/associative}. 
Basic texts on group algebras are Lam's book \cite{MR1125071}
and Passman's book \cite{MR798076}.
% are for example \cite{MR1645586}\dots

% As usual, we also mention a set of great expository papers by 
% Keith Conrad available at 
% \url{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/}. 
% The notes are extremely well-written and are useful at  
% at every stage of a mathematical career. 
 
Thanks go to Arjen Elbert Dujardin, Robynn Corveleyn and
Jos√© Navarro Villegas. 
%Arne van Antwerpen, Luca Descheemaeker, Lucas Simons
